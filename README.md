# Enhanced Epoch Performance With Depth Layer
optimize training performance through the strategic incorporation of depth layers between hidden layers in neural networks. This approach aims to enhance the efficacy of each training epoch by introducing additional layers to the network architecture, thereby promoting deeper feature extraction and representation learning.
